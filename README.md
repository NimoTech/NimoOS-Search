# NimoOS-Search

RAG retrieval API for NimoOS — aggregates a filename index and vector recall across sources behind `/v1/search`.

> ### About
>
> NimoOS is a fork of [CasaOS](https://github.com/IceWhaleTech/CasaOS)
> (Apache-2.0), originally developed by IceWhale Technology Co., Ltd.
> Building on that foundation, NimoOS adds an AI agent, RAG-based retrieval,
> a knowledge layer, and a built-in web terminal.
>
> See [`NOTICE`](./NOTICE) for attribution details. CasaOS and IceWhale are

> This repository is NimoTech's own work and contains no CasaOS-derived code.


> ⚠️ Multi-user isolation is incomplete — Photos and Search are not yet

## Building

NimoOS is a multi-repository project. Every Go service uses a `replace`
directive pointing at the local `NimoOS-Common` checkout, so a build needs the
full workspace — see
[NimoOS-Build](https://github.com/NimoTech/NimoOS-Build) for the layout and the
one-line clone helper.

`NimoOS-MessageBus` must be generated first; its generated API code is not
committed and other services' `go generate` consumes its OpenAPI spec.

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...   # pure Go
go test ./...
```

Go services pin `go 1.21` and echo v4.12 — **do not run `go mod tidy`**.
